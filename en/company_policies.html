                    <p class="lead">Throughout these Policies, when the term "Agreement" is used, it collectively refers
                        to the FGV Independent Distributor Application and Agreement (the "Independent Distributor
                        Agreement"), these Policies and the FGV Compensation Plan. These documents are incorporated by
                        reference into the FGV L Independent Agreement (all in their current form and as amended from
                        time to time by FGV). It is the responsibility of each Independent Distributor to read,
                        understand, adhere to, and ensure that he or she is aware of and operating under the most
                        current version of these Policies. When referring a new Independent Distributor, it is the
                        responsibility of the sponsoring I.D to ensure that the applicant is provided with, or has
                        online access to, the most current [POLICIES & PROCEDURES GUIDE page 2] version of these
                        Policies and the FGV Compensation Plan prior to his or her execution of the I.D Agreement.</p>
                    <p class="lead"><b>B. Amendments</b></p>
                    <p class="lead">Future Global Vision reserves the right to amend the Agreement and its prices at its
                        sole and absolute discretion. By signing the I.D Agreement, a I.D agrees to abide by all
                        amendments or modifications that FGV elects to make. Amendments shall be effective upon written
                        notice to all I.D that the Agreement has been modified. Notification of amendments shall be
                        published in official Future Global Vision materials. The Company shall provide or make
                        available to all I.D a complete copy of the amended provisions by one or more of the following

                    <p class="lead"><b>A. Purpose</b></p>
                    <p class="lead">FGV is a direct sales company that markets its products through Independent I.D. It
                        is important to understand that your success and the success of your fellow I.D depend on the
                        integrity of the men and women who market our products and services. To clearly define the
                        relationship that exists between I.D and FGV, and to explicitly set a standard for acceptable
                        business conduct, Future Global Vision has established the Agreement.</p>
                    <p class="lead"><b>B. Compliance</b></p>
                    <p class="lead">FGV's I.D are required to comply with all of the terms and conditions set forth in
                        the Agreement, as well as all federal, state, and local laws governing their FGV business and
                        their conduct. Because you may be unfamiliar with many of these standards of practice, it is
                        very important that you read and abide by the Agreement. Please review the information in these
                        Policies carefully. It explains and governs the relationship [POLICIES & PROCEDURES GUIDE page
                        3] between you, as an independent contractor and the Company. Please note that the Company
                        and/or its third party administrators charge ongoing fees for the processing and issuance of
                        commissions and bonuses which will be deducted from your commission payments. If you have any
                        questions regarding any policy or rule, do not hesitate to seek an answer from anyone in your
                        upline or Future Global Vision ("FGV").</p>
                    <h3 class="h3">3. Code of Ethics</h3>

                    <p class="lead">
                        I will be respectful of every person I meet while doing FGV related business <br>

                        sound manner. I will not engage in activities that would bring disrepute to FGV, any FGV
                        corporate officer or employee, myself, or other I.D.<br>
                        I will not make discouraging, disparaging or untrue statements or claims directed toward the
                        Company, its officers, employees or other FGV I.D. I will ensure that in all FGV business

                        are returned to FGV. Goods that are no longer marketed by FGV shall be deemed "resalable or

                        right or power under the Agreement or to insist upon strict compliance by a I.D with any
                        [POLICIES & PROCEDURES GUIDE PAGE 34] obligation or provision of the Agreement, and no custom or

                        only in writing by an authorized officer of the Company. FGV's waiver of any particular breach

                        FGV shall not constitute a defense to FGV's enforcement of any term or provision of the
